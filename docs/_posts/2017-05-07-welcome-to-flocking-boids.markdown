> TL;DR: [checkout boids flocking]({{ "/game/" | relative_url }})

I have always been interested in emergent behavior. For me an interesting way to explore this is through computer simulation.

I have also been following OpenGL and how it has become ubiquitos over time to the point where it can now be found in phones and in the browser.

Give all of the above I thought a good way to pull all this together was to implment flocking in the browser as it makes it easy to see results and share them.
