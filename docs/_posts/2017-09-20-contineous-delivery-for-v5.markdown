Journey to VR
---
In this version I would like to integrate VR into the current experience.

This is inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/jT2mR9WzJ7Y) on the Google Chrome Developers channel.

Will start with the [web-vr polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) mentioned in the above vid and take it from there.
